# ReactBlog

## What is ReactBlog?

ReactBlog is a rewrite of the blog CMS currently integrated into the monolith architecture of [my website](https://forsakenidol.com), as well as a means for me to practise the React.js framework.

## Why React?

In mid-November, I was learning Docker, and for practise, I needed an application to "Dockerise". At the same time, I become interested in the React.js framework; I had previously looked at this framework with TypeScript for an internship I was doing with an Australian startup company, and wanted to revisit and learn this framework properly. After completing the tutorial, I realized I had a simple application to write a Dockerfile for!

I've since discovered React's potential, and wanted to further explore its power and improve my fluency with this framework, and so what better way to do so than to design an application in React?

## Development

*Placeholder section, no running scripts have been set up yet.*

Simply clone the repository, run `npm install` in the root directory, and `npm run dev`.

I've made a concerted effort to modularize as many components as possible, and whilst developing, I will attempt to create functional components as often as I can and lift state up as far as is practical.
